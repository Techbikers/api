            </header>

            <p>
                TechBikers was born in 2012 from Google Campus in London as a means for the tech community to put down their laptops and pick up a bike to support charity, network, share ideas and spread the start-up vibe.
            </p>

            <p>
                Behind TechBikers is Eze Vidra, head of Google Campus, Benjamin Southworth, ex Deputy CEO at Tech City UK, and Abraham Choi, Founder of Decision Analytics and Mark Jennings.

            <p>
                To date we have ridden 640 km and donated almost £100,000 to charity.
            </p>

            <p>
                At its core is a 3 day 320km ride from Paris to London taking 70 mixed ability riders on a challenging but safe experience, but it is so much more - it is 4 month programme of training rides, group meetings, personal fundraising and support that is shared across social media and in the press, before, during and after the ride.
            </p>

            <p>
                We apply startup methodologies of agility, programmatic intelligence, hard work and great fun to create a unique, effective and transparent organisation.
            </p>

            <p>
                To ensure that the maximum amount of money reaches the charity, we cover our ride costs with sponsorship, and that presents some exciting, and tangible reasons to get involved.
